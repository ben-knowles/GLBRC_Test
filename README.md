# GLBRC_Test

This app was written in Python 3.9.6 using the PyCharm editor in Windows 10 Pro. Dependencies are listed in the 
requirements.txt file and can be installed via pip ("python -m pip install <library>").

To run the app, fork a branch to a local repository and run app.py from a command terminal ("python app.py") or from
within an editor like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code. A server will be spun up on local port 8080.
